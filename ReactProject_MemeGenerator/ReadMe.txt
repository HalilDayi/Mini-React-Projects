-The goal of this project is understanding the basic use of the useEffect hook and fetch data retrieval from a source.

-In this project, we can see that the states of the form elements change with the state we determine.

-The incoming data includes a variety of meme image. When the button is pressed, a random meme image appears. You can write whatever you want on this meme image and produce your own meme.

-After creating the react project with the command "npx create-react-app meme-generator", you can use the application after placing folders and pages in specific places.

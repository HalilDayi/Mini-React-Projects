This static project is the first example of Mini React Projects.

In this project, you can examine how the corresponding html codes are distributed to different components and how these components are rendered in a format that we can understand in the browser.

All the components are merged in App.js file. This App.js file is rendered in index.js file.

For seeing the same output as the picture, you should create react app first. Then put all the files inside of src file except ReadMe.txt and output_image.txt
